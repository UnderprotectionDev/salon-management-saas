## Business Terms

### Appointment

A scheduled time slot where a customer receives one or more services from a staff member. Also referred to as "booking" or "randevu" (Turkish).

**States:** pending, confirmed, checked_in, in_progress, completed, cancelled, no_show

### Booking

See [Appointment](#appointment). Used interchangeably, though "booking" often refers to the act of creating an appointment, while "appointment" refers to the scheduled event itself.

### Check-in

The process of marking a customer as arrived at the salon for their appointment. Triggers notification to the assigned staff member.

### Checkout

The process of completing an appointment, recording services rendered, products sold, and payment received.

### Confirmation Code

A 6-character alphanumeric code uniquely identifying an appointment within an organization. Generated by `convex/lib/confirmation.ts`. Excludes ambiguous characters (0, O, I, 1) to prevent confusion. Used for public appointment lookup at `/:slug/appointment/:code`.

**Format:** `A3B7K9` (uppercase letters + digits 2-9, excluding 0/O/I/1)

### Customer

An individual who books and receives services at a salon. May or may not have a registered account. Also referred to as "müşteri" (Turkish).

### No-Show

When a customer fails to appear for their scheduled appointment without cancelling. Typically marked after 15 minutes past appointment time.

### Organization

A single salon business entity in the multi-tenant system. Each organization has its own staff, services, customers, and appointments.

**Also known as:** "Tenant" (architectural), "Salon" (user-facing)

**Terminology Guidelines:**

| Context | Preferred Term | Rationale | Examples |
|---------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| **Code & Database** | `organization` | Matches schema table names | `organizationId`, `organization.slug`, `ctx.organizationId` |
| **User Interface** | `salon` | More intuitive for salon owners/staff | "Select your salon", "Salon settings", "Switch salons" |
| **Architecture Docs** | `tenant` | Industry-standard multi-tenancy term | "Tenant isolation", "Per-tenant data", "Tenant context" |
| **API Documentation** | `organization` | Consistency with code/schema | `organizations.create`, `orgQuery`, `organizationSettings` |
| **PRD/Specs** | `organization` or `salon` | Context-dependent (use organization for technical, salon for features) | Technical: "Organization table", User-facing: "Salon onboarding" |

**Important:** Do NOT mix terms within the same document section. Pick the appropriate term for the context and use it consistently.

**Examples of Correct Usage:**
- ✅ Code: `const org = await ctx.db.get(ctx.organizationId);`
- ✅ UI Text: "You can switch between your salons using the dropdown."
- ✅ Architecture: "The system uses tenant-based data isolation."
- ✅ API: `api.organizations.getBySlug({ slug })`

**Examples of Incorrect Usage:**
- ❌ Code: `const salon = await ctx.db.get(ctx.tenantId);` (mismatched with schema)
- ❌ UI Text: "Select your organization" (too formal/technical)
- ❌ Architecture: "Each salon has isolated data" (not standard terminology)

**See also:** [Salon](#salon), [Tenant](#tenant)

### Service

A specific offering that a salon provides (e.g., haircut, coloring, manicure). Has associated duration, price, and eligible staff.

**Attributes:**
- Name
- Description
- Duration (in minutes)
- Price (in TRY)
- Category

### Service Category

A grouping of related services (e.g., "Hair", "Nails", "Makeup"). Used for organizing the service catalog.

### Staff

An employee or team member of a salon. Has a membership role (owner, admin, member) via the `member` table and a professional profile in the `staff` table.

### Salon

**User-facing term** for an [Organization](#organization). Preferred in UI text and customer-facing communications.

Use "salon" when:
- Writing UI labels, buttons, and messages
- Describing features from the user's perspective
- Creating marketing or help documentation
- The audience is salon owners, staff, or customers

**See [Organization](#organization)** for the complete terminology guidelines and when to use "organization" vs "salon" vs "tenant".

### Tenant

**Architectural term** for an [Organization](#organization). Used in multi-tenancy discussions and system architecture documentation.

Use "tenant" when:
- Discussing data isolation strategies
- Describing multi-tenancy architecture
- Writing technical architecture documents
- Explaining how the system handles multiple organizations

**Technical implementation:** Each tenant's data is isolated using `organizationId` foreign keys in all tables. See [Multi-Tenancy Architecture](../04-technical/architecture.md#multi-tenancy-architecture) for details.

**See [Organization](#organization)** for the complete terminology guidelines.

### Walk-in

A customer who arrives at the salon without a prior appointment and requests immediate service.

## Subscription & Billing Terms

### MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)

The total predictable revenue generated from active subscriptions in a given month. Calculated as the sum of all monthly subscription fees (yearly subscriptions divided by 12).

**Example:**
- 10 monthly subscriptions × ₺500 = ₺5,000
- 5 yearly subscriptions × (₺5,100/12) = ₺2,125
- **Total MRR: ₺7,125**

### ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)

The annualized value of recurring revenue. Calculated as MRR × 12.

### Churn Rate

The percentage of subscribers who cancel their subscription within a given period. Lower is better.

**Formula:** `(Cancelled subscriptions in period / Total subscriptions at start) × 100`

**Target:** <5% monthly churn

### Grace Period

A 7-day window after a payment failure during which the organization retains full access while attempting to resolve the payment issue. Reminder emails are sent on days 1, 3, 5, and 7.

### Subscription Status

The current state of an organization's subscription:

| Status | Description | Access Level |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `trialing` | New organization, in trial period | Full (trial) |
| `active` | Payment successful, subscription current | Full |
| `past_due` | Payment failed, in grace period | Full (with warnings) |
| `canceled` | User cancelled, access until period end | Full until end date |
| `unpaid` | Grace period expired, no payment | Billing page only |

### ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)

Average monthly revenue generated per subscribing organization. For a single-tier product, this equals the monthly price (₺500 for monthly, ₺425 for yearly).

## Technical Terms

### Action (Convex)

A Convex function that can perform side effects like calling external APIs. Unlike mutations, actions can be async and don't run in transactions.

### Better Auth

An authentication framework used for handling user login, session management, and identity verification. Integrates with Convex via adapter.

### Convex

The backend platform used for database, server functions, and real-time subscriptions. Provides a unified solution for data storage and API.

### Google OAuth

The primary authentication method. Users sign in via their Google account through the Better Auth social provider integration.

### Magic Link (Planned)

A passwordless authentication method where users receive a unique, time-limited link via email to log in. Not yet implemented.

### Multi-tenancy

An architecture where a single application instance serves multiple organizations (tenants) while keeping their data isolated.

### Mutation (Convex)

A Convex function that modifies database state. Runs in a transaction ensuring ACID properties.

### OTP (One-Time Password) (Planned)

A temporary code (usually 6 digits) sent via SMS or email to verify user identity. Originally planned for booking verification in Milestone 3 but deferred. Booking currently proceeds without OTP verification.

### Query (Convex)

A Convex function that reads data from the database. Can be subscribed to for real-time updates.

### Slot

A time period available for booking. Typically in 15-minute increments.

### Session ID

A browser-generated unique identifier used for slot lock ownership. Each browser tab has a session ID that ties slot locks to the booking session. Allows anonymous (unauthenticated) users to hold and release locks during the booking flow.

### Slot Lock

A temporary reservation of a time slot during the booking process. Prevents double-booking when multiple users attempt to book simultaneously. Has a TTL (time-to-live) of 2 minutes (120,000ms).

**Implementation:** `convex/slotLocks.ts` with `acquire` (publicMutation), `release` (publicMutation), and `cleanupExpired` (internalMutation, cron every 1 minute). One lock per session; acquiring a new lock releases the previous one.

### Subscription (Convex)

A real-time connection that automatically updates the client when underlying data changes.

### Tenant

See [Organization](#organization).
